# Minesweeper
Creating Minesweeper game in windows by C#  

I implemented minesweeper game using C#

Randomly creating map when it is initiated. 

Gamers have to find mines and mark all of them. Then, the game is over. 

Basic rules are the same as original Minsweeper game on Windows.

Enjoy!  - Seokho Han -
